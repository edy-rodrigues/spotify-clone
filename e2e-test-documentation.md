# Spotify Clone E2E Tests Documentation

This document provides an overview of the end-to-end (E2E) tests implemented for the Spotify Clone application using Cypress.

## Test Files Structure

The E2E tests are organized into the following files:

1. `e2e/home.cy.ts` - Tests for the home page
2. `e2e/search.cy.ts` - Tests for the search page
3. `e2e/search-results.cy.ts` - Tests for the search results page
4. `e2e/artist-details.cy.ts` - Tests for the artist details page

## Test Coverage

### Home Page Tests (`home.cy.ts`)

- Basic page loading verification
- Navigation to an artist's page when clicking on an artist card

### Search Page Tests (`search.cy.ts`)

- Verification of search input field
- Typing in the search field
- Navigation to search results page when typing a search term
- Clearing the search input

### Search Results Page Tests (`search-results.cy.ts`)

- Display of search results for a given term
- Filter options functionality
- Navigation to an artist page when clicking on an artist card
- Changing the search term

### Artist Details Page Tests (`artist-details.cy.ts`)

- Display of artist information
- Display of albums table
- Navigation through album pages using pagination
- Display of top tracks section
- Interaction with album rows

## Running the Tests

To run the E2E tests:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the Cypress tests:
   ```
   npm run cypress:open
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm run cypress:run
   ```

## Test Implementation Details

### Key Testing Strategies

1. **Page Navigation**: Tests verify that users can navigate between different pages by clicking on links and cards.

2. **Search Functionality**: Tests ensure that the search functionality works correctly, including typing in the search field and navigating to search results.

3. **Pagination**: Tests verify that pagination controls work correctly on the artist details page.

4. **Content Loading**: Tests check that content is properly loaded and displayed on each page.

5. **User Interactions**: Tests simulate user interactions like clicking, typing, and hovering.

### Test Data

- For search tests, we use "Taylor Swift" as a search term
- For artist details tests, we use a known artist ID (Taylor Swift's ID)

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the E2E test suite:

1. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
2. Implement visual regression testing
3. Add tests for responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Implement test data mocking to avoid reliance on the actual Spotify API
